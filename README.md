🧠 Smart Posture Correction and Detection Belt
An IoT-based wearable health-tech solution designed to detect and correct poor spinal posture in real-time. The system uses the MPU6050 (Gyroscope + Accelerometer) sensor to monitor back alignment and alerts the user through a buzzer or vibration motor whenever slouching or incorrect posture is detected.

This project also includes a web application that visualizes posture data, logs user history, and helps improve daily sitting habits. Built as part of Innovera and DIPEX hackathons, the system is lightweight, cost-effective, and easy to wear.
